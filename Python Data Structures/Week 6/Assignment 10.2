10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
name = input("Enter file:") 
if len(name) < 1 : 
      name = mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name) 
counts=dict()
for line in handle:
      if line.startswith("From ") is True:
            lin=line.split()
            l=1in[5]
            hr=l[:2] 
            counts[hr]=counfs.get(hr,0)+1 
for k,v in sorted(counts.items()):
      print(k,v)
